This is a exercise to test some API calls.
The purpose is to request a "CEP" and the program should get the geolocation associated with this "CEP".
In order to do this, the program have to call the API available on viacep.com.br - After that, the program calls the other API - available on # https://apiprevmet3.inmet.gov.br/estacao/proxima/<geocode>
Finally, it prints the result without the user know that all of these calls had been made.

ATTENTION:
Before running this example, make sure you have python3 and pip installed, then run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies properly.
